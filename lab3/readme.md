# Introduction to Design Patterns

**Design Patterns** are established solutions to common software design problems. They provide reusable templates for addressing challenges in system architecture, improving code organization, flexibility, and scalability.

Design patterns aren't pieces of code but rather guidelines or frameworks that help in solving specific design issues across various contexts. They are typically divided into three main categories:

1. **Creational Patterns** – Focus on object creation mechanisms.
2. **Structural Patterns** – Focus on organizing classes and objects into larger structures.
3. **Behavioral Patterns** – Focus on the interactions between objects.
